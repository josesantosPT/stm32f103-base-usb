# stm32f103-base-usb
Base code for stm32f103c8 USB connection to create a virtual COM Port on Windows
Project for Atollic TRUEStudio and stm32f103c8 microcontroller board, was tested on the great STM32 "blue pill".

The only implemented behaviour is the switching of the PC13 led when a "1" or "0" is received through the USB <-> Virtual COM connection.
